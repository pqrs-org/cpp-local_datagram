# cpp-local_datagram

local datagram server and client.

- Server and client work asynchronously. (using pqrs::dispatcher)
- Server and client can be used safely in a multi-threaded environment.
- Server will restart automatically when service is down. (e.g., when the socket file is removed.)
- Client will reconnect automatically when the connection is closed unintendedly. (e.g., when the server is down.)
